# Telegram-Smart
## Introduction
This code is based on Telegram BOT Library for ESP8266. This project creates an interface between a Telegram Bot and a Arduino (Any), providing total control over it. It is composed by two Arduino codes:

1. ESP8266 code
2. Arduino UNO code

## ESP8266 code
It creates an interface between Telegram API and a Arduino. It is based on Gianbacchio's ESP8266-TelegramBot code.


## Arduino UNO code
